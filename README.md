## About?
[Pictionary with Friends](https://aqueous-ravine-28405.herokuapp.com/) is an passion project built by a curious yet lonely programer over quarantine. The project is hosted on [heroku](https://heroku.com/). The site allows for a maximum of 20 users to actively play, currently, due to constraints of the free version of heroku.

## Features

The project currently has the following features:

* Character selection
* Game room creation
* Joining existing games
* Lobby room with Chat and characters displayed
* Game room with characters displayed
* Chat box in game to provide answers
* Canvas
* Local cookie allows user to save and access the character selected, score and other data

## In-progress

The features I am currently working on:

* User turns
* Allowing user to select time, number of rounds
* Leader board, change position accordning to points

## Future-goals

I look to incorporate the following features in the near future:

* Client turns update 
* More drawing capabilities
* AI bot to play against
* Ability to handle large traffic to the site

## Resources

* **Node.js** An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
* **Linux** Makes my life easier
* **Chat** Chat using sockets [generic template](https://socket.io/demos/chat/)
* **Canvas drawing** Drawing on canvas using sockets [generic template](https://socket.io/demos/whiteboard/)
